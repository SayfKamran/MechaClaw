<h1>MechaClaw (Robotic Arm) </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
The MechaClaw project involved designing and building a robotic arm equipped with a claw, controlled using ultrasonic sensors. The main objective was to create a functional prototype that could autonomously detect and lift a small garbage can, then dump it into a designated area. This project was a hands-on exercise in robotics, sensor integration, and mechanical design.

Key Features:

Sensor-Controlled Operation:
The robotic arm was controlled using ultrasonic sensors, enabling distance-based detection and movement. This allowed for semi-autonomous control of the arm and its claw mechanism without manual input.

Mechanical Design:
The entire arm and claw were custom-built using CAD tools to ensure optimal range of motion and precise grasping capabilities.

Motorized Movement:
Motors were used to drive the various joints of the arm, providing smooth and reliable motion. The motor control was managed through the Arduino, responding to input from the ultrasonic sensors.

Technologies Used:

Hardware:
Arduino microcontroller for sensor processing and motor control
Ultrasonic sensors for detecting objects and controlling the arm’s position
Motors for joint actuation
Custom-designed frame and claw mechanism built using lightweight materials
Software:
Arduino IDE for programming control logic
CAD software for mechanical design

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

C++ – This is used to write Arduino's control logic and motor control program.
Arduino IDE – For coding, compiling, and uploading the program to the Arduino board.
CAD Software (e.g., SolidWorks) – For designing the mechanical components of the robotic arm.
Ultrasonic Sensors – These are used for object detection and triggering specific arm movements.
Motors – Used for joint actuation and driving the movement of the arm and claw.
Breadboard and Wiring – For assembling and integrating the electronics of the project.

<h2>Environments Used </h2>
Windows 10 (21H2) – Used for programming the Arduino and running the CAD software.
Arduino Hardware Environment – Used for uploading and testing the control logic on the robotic arm.
